Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.You can opt-out of having your activity on the Service made available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.
